    "\n",
    "Solution\n",
    "All of the ${52 \\choose 5}$ possible hands are equally likely by symmetry, so the naive definition is applicable. To find the number of full house hands, use the multiplication rule (and imagine the tree). There are 13 choices for what rank we have three of; for concreteness, assume we have three 7's and focus on that branch of the tree. There are ${4 \\choose 3}$ ways to choose which 7's we have. Then there are 12 choices for what rank we have two of, say 10's for concreteness, and {4 \\choose 2} ways to choose two 10's. Thus,\n",

The decimal approximation is more useful when playing poker, but the answer in terms of binomial coefficients is exact and self-annotating (seeing ''${52 \\choose 5}$\" is a much bigger hint of its origin than seeing ''2598960\")"
